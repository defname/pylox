I'm currently reading the awesome book ["Crafting Interpreters"](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)] by Rober Nystrom, in which he describes how to write an interpreter for Lox as an example language.

This is pretty much the implementation he describes written in Python.
I also implemented most of the challenges (like ternery expressions, nameless functions, ...).

Still work in progess...
